## üöÄ Deployment Platforms

### Streamlit Cloud

## üîç Final Verification

### Before Making Repository Public

1. **Clone to temporary directory and review**:
   ```bash
   git clone /path/to/your/repo /tmp/public-review
   cd /tmp/public-review
   ```

2. **Search for sensitive data**:
   ```bash
   # Search for potential API keys
   grep -r "sk-" . || echo "No API keys found"
   grep -r "secret" . || echo "No secrets found"
   grep -r "password" . || echo "No passwords found"
   
   # Check file sizes
   find . -size +10M -type f
   ```

3. **Test deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Copy .env.example to .env and add test values
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with test API key
   
   # Test local run
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### After Deployment

- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] All features work as expected
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data

## üÜò Emergency Response

If sensitive data is accidentally exposed:

1. **Immediately revoke compromised credentials**
2. **Change all related passwords/keys**
3. **Remove sensitive data from git history**:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch path/to/sensitive/file' \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```
4. **Force push to update remote**:
   ```bash
   git push origin --force --all
   ```
5. **Notify relevant security teams**
