# ðŸ”§ Excel File Upload Fix

## Issue Description
Users were experiencing the error: `Error loading file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'temp_file.xlsx'` when deploying the application on Streamlit Cloud or other hosting platforms.

## Root Cause
The original code in `app.py` was creating temporary files in the current working directory:
```python
# Old problematic code
with open("temp_file.xlsx", "wb") as f:
    f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())
```

This caused issues because:
1. **Permission Problems**: Hosting platforms may not allow writing to the current directory
2. **File Cleanup**: Manual cleanup with `os.remove()` could fail
3. **Concurrency Issues**: Multiple users uploading files simultaneously could conflict

## Solution Implemented
Updated the `load_excel_file()` function to use Python's `tempfile` module:

```python
# New improved code
import tempfile

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, suffix='.xlsx') as tmp_file:
    tmp_file.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())
    tmp_file_path = tmp_file.name

try:
    # Process the file
    excel_reader = ExcelReader()
    sheets = excel_reader.read_excel(tmp_file_path)
    # ... rest of processing
finally:
    # Always clean up temp file
    try:
        os.remove(tmp_file_path)
    except OSError:
        pass  # File already deleted or not accessible
```

## Key Improvements

### âœ… Better File Location
- Uses system temporary directory (`/tmp` on Unix, `%TEMP%` on Windows)
- Guaranteed to have write permissions

### âœ… Robust Cleanup
- Uses `try/finally` to ensure cleanup happens even if processing fails
- Graceful handling of cleanup errors

### âœ… Enhanced Error Handling
- Added proper logging of errors
- More informative error messages for users

### âœ… Platform Compatibility
- Works on all hosting platforms (Streamlit Cloud, Railway, Heroku, etc.)
- Compatible with containerized environments (Docker)

## Files Modified
- `app.py`: Updated `load_excel_file()` function
- Added `import tempfile` to imports

## Testing
The fix has been tested to ensure:
- âœ… Temporary files are created in the correct location
- âœ… Files are properly cleaned up after processing
- âœ… Error handling works correctly
- âœ… Multiple file uploads work without conflicts

## Deployment Notes
This fix is backward compatible and requires no additional dependencies. It will resolve the file upload issues on:

- **Streamlit Cloud** âœ…
- **Railway** âœ…  
- **Heroku** âœ…
- **AWS/GCP/Azure** âœ…
- **Docker containers** âœ…
- **Local development** âœ…

The application should now work correctly for Excel file uploads across all deployment environments.
